        Why do singaporeans celebrate National Day?
    </h2>
    <h5>The reason behind that is  National Day in Singapore is celebrated every year on August 9 to commemorate Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965. The holiday features a National Day Parade, an address by the Prime Minister of Singapore, and fireworks celebrations. The origin of the day goes back to 1963 when the Federations of Malaya, Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, but civil and political unrests made it impossible for the merger to survive.</h5>
